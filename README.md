## HW1 Genetic Algorithm

### problem

One classic problem which is called **traveling salesman problem**. Imagine being a traveling salesman with several houses you have to visit every day. Theyâ€™re all spread throughout the city, so you have to figure out the route that will let you visit them all in the shortest time.

### steps

1. For a given problem, we should **encode** a solution in the form of a stream of DNA where every gene is one of the parameters of the solution
2. Create a **population** of random solutions
3. Evaluate these random solutions, and assign points to them which is called **fitness**.
4. Sort them by points and discard the lower half.
5. Grab the top half of the remaining population, and mix it with the other half which will perform **crossover** and **mutate**
6. Back to step 3

### example code

predefined distances between cities:

### Conclusion

The code is just a simple example of GA(Genetic Algorithm), and it don't consider many things such as initial points and backtracking, but GA is a interesting way to solving complex problems by letting the solution evolve on its own.

Although GA is not fit for all problems, it is still a useful way to solve problems like finding the best route, job assignment, string comparison, etc. I will find some interesting problems that could be solved by GA in reality and try to implement it in practice.
